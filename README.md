# Decentralized Voting Application

## Overview
This project showcases a decentralized voting application leveraging the Ethereum blockchain. It integrates a Solidity smart contract for the voting mechanism with a ReactJS frontend for user interaction.

## Features
- Ethereum blockchain integration for secure and transparent voting.
- Smart contract implementation in Solidity.
- ReactJS frontend for a responsive and interactive user interface.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Hardhat for Ethereum development

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/raghav-dubey-avid/tdc-web3-team

2. **Install Dependencies:**
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:
npm install

3. **Compile and Deploy the Contract:**
Compile the Solidity contract and deploy it to the specified blockchain network:
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run --network volta scripts/deploy.js

Replace `volta` with your preferred network.

4. **Environment Setup:**
After deploying the contract, copy the contract address to the `.env` file in your project root. Update the blockchain endpoint in the `hardhat-config.js` if using a different network.

5. **Start the Application:**
Launch the React application:
npm start

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can interact with the smart contract through the React interface to participate in the voting process.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome. Please ensure to follow the standard coding practices and create a pull request for any changes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
